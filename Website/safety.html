        <p>Unfortunately there is almost no way to stay completely safe unless you were to never leave your house and even then its
        not going to be easy to avoid people completely. Luckily the CDC has prepared some guidelines to reduce the risks of infection
        According to the

        <h3>How to Protect Yourself When Going Out</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth to help protect yourself and others.</li>
            <li>Choose a mask with two or more layers of washable, breathable fabric that fits snugly against the sides of your face.</li>
            <li>Stay 6 feet apart and avoid crowds.</li>
            <li>The more people you are in contact with, the more likely you are to be exposed to COVID-19.</li>
            <li>Avoid indoor spaces as much as possible, particularly ones that aren’t well ventilated.</li>
            <li>You may find it harder to stay 6 feet apart in indoor spaces.</li>
            <li>Wash your hands often.</li>
            <li>Use soap and water for 20 seconds, especially after you have been in a public place or hand sanitizer if soap and water aren’t available.</li>
